# Udemy Course Scraper

This is a python notebook to script information about the courses you have purchase
(or possibly just watched if using the subscription) on youtube.

Due to the shenanigans of cloudflare you'll need to log in manually once. This is nice with the Jupyter Notebook
because it's just chunks you run before and after. I decided to use a Jupyter Notebook because I have hardly used them
&mdash; if even at all &mdash; since finishing college. I thought I'd give them another try.
